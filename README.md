The AlignedX Model is an open-source, structured framework that aligns strategy, execution and outcomes to orchestrate digital and technology-driven business value transformation. The AlignedX Model organizes nine interconnected models—with the Value Stream Model as the foundational structure—to ensure that every goal, objective, outcome, experience, capability, process, information, technology and execution component is traceable and strategically linked. 
Most business transformation initiatives fail due to strategy–execution misalignment. The AlignedX Model is now open-source on GitHub. Explore, adopt, contribute.
